# Voice_Tunes

What would your voice sound like if it were a grand piano?

Voice Tunes records raw audio, converts the recording to MIDI, and allows users to play the file back as a grand piano. Users can also create a username to share their tunes, remove recordings and re-record, and save their work either in the app or to their computer.

This app builds off of, but is not affiliated with, Piano Scribe[https://piano-scribe.glitch.me/], an incredible open source project that transcribes audio files in the browser using Magenta.js[https://magenta.tensorflow.org/] and TensorFlow.js[https://www.tensorflow.org/js/].

Want to take your tune to the next level and see what it might look like as sheet music? 

Try uploadomg your tune to [Midi Sheet Music](http://midisheetmusic.com)! You will need to download the program, but it's free, takes a minute, and is definitely worth it.
